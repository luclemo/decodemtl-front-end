notes: Even though phases 1-2-3 will look better if the images all share similar sizes, the layout will arrange itself automatically for different sizes. For Phase four, the two smaller images can be different sizes but must share the same ratio (`4:3` or `16:9` etc). The middle image can be any size.

					<h4>Phase 1 - Programming Fundamentals</h4>
					<p>DecodeMTL takes a projects based approach while focusing on the fundamentals of javascript. Including the final projects the students will build a total of 4 projects in groups and create a number of smaller individual projects.  In the first week, we deepen our understanding of javascript and student team up to build a browser based game.</p>

					<h4>Phase 3 - Front-End Web Development</h4>
					<p>In week 4 we focus on HTML and CSS and practice building responsive layouts. We put these skills to the work with a number of individual web projects using pure vanilla Javascript. These projects include a weather app, a flicker search app, and a blackjack game. Week 5 sees the introduction of ReactJS to take our front-end development to the next level.</p>
