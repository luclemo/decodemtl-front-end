					<p>DecodeMTL takes a projects based approach while focusing on the fundamentals of javascript. Including the final projects the students will build a total of 4 projects in groups and create a number of smaller individual projects.  In the first week, we deepen our understanding of javascript and student team up to build a browser based game.</p>

These projects include a weather app, a flicker search app, and a blackjack game. Week 5 sees the introduction of ReactJS to take our front-end development to the next level.</p>
