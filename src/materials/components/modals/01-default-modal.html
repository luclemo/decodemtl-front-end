notes: modals must always include the close button as a direct child. All content should go inside any block element with a <code>.modal-content</code> class.

<div class="modal">
	{{> miscellaneous.close-button}}
	<div class="modal-content">
		<p>This is the default style for a modal box. In context it would be full screen.</p>
	</div>
</div><!-- /.modal -->
